# NYC-Airbnb-Price-Prediction
This is a group project in collaboration with Ziyue Dong and Jiyang Ge.

Abstract: This project focuses on predicting prices for airbnb in NYC. We consider it as a
supervised regression problem.We approached it using Linear and Ridge Regression, Random
Forest, Linear SVR and KNN. Despite all the advantages and disadvantages of each approach,
the results showed that Random Forest had the best performance for this problem. For inspiration
of future predicting models, ensemble methods and deep learning may improve our model more.
